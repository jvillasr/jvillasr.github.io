title: "SDSS-V OBA Stars"
subtitle: "Most massive stars live with a close companion and often exchange matter during their lives. We use SDSS-V spectra to map how common these companions are and to find unusual systems—some of which could be the ancestors of the black-hole and neutron-star mergers seen in gravitational waves."

## Overview
Massive stars rarely live alone. Because many orbit each other closely, they can pull material from one another; these interactions set up the systems that later become pairs of black holes or neutron stars. With SDSS-V we observe each star several times and look for small shifts in their spectral lines. Those shifts reveal hidden companions and let us measure how frequent binaries are across different masses, ages, environments and metallicities. From these data we flag special cases—like stars that have been stripped by a companion or candidates that may host a black hole—and then follow them with high-resolution spectroscopy to confirm their nature. Seeing these “in-between” stages helps us connect everyday massive binaries to the gravitational-wave sources detected today.

• Role: Leading author on the multiplicity of OBA stars<br>
• Data: SDSS-V <code>mwm_ob_core</code>, three epochs per star<br>
• Telescope instrument: The Sloan Foundation 2.5m Telescope at Apache Point Observatory / The Irénée du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. BOSS spectrographs
• Method: Radial-velocity changes to identify close binaries and interaction products<br>
• Follow-up: High-resolution spectroscopy of top candidates<br>
• Goal: Constrain how massive binaries evolve toward GW-source progenitors

<strong>Manuscript in prep</strong><br>
Working title: <em>Multiplicity of OBA Stars in SDSS-V</em><br>
Scope: multi-epoch spectra of OBA stars (Galactic + nearby environments).<br>
Approach: RV variability across three epochs; probabilistic classification of single vs. binary; selection of interaction-product candidates (e.g., stripped/bloated stars, BH candidates).<br>
Status: analysis complete; figures drafted; internal review next.
