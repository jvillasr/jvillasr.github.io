title: "Binarity at Low Metallicity (BLOeM)"
subtitle: "How does a metal-poor environment change the lives of massive binary stars? BLOeM tracks binary systems in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) to learn about their multiplicity properties at a metallicity five times lower than that of the Milky Way."

hero_caption: "Binary stars are more common in metal-poor places. For B-type stars the binary fraction rises from the Milky Way (solar metal content) to the LMC (~1/2 solar) and SMC (~1/5 solar). The line shows the best-fit trend with its uncertainty; red points are lower-mass stars for comparison; the purple line shows the trend for O-type stars."

## Overview

At low metallicity (few heavy elements), stellar winds are weaker and stars lose less mass. That changes how binary stars exchange matter, spin up, and eventually collapse—and it likely affects the kinds of compact-object pairs we see in gravitational waves.  
BLOeM targets massive stars in the metal-poor **Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC; ~1/5 the Milky Way’s metallicity)** with repeated spectroscopy. We look for subtle shifts in spectral lines to reveal hidden companions, measure how common binaries are, and identify interaction products.

## My contributions
- Contributed to observing proposals.
- Analysis of RV variability for B-type dwarfs and giants.
- First-author paper on the multiplicity of B-type dwarfs and giants.
- Co-author on the first BLOeM paper and subsequent multiplicity papers.

## Key results (so far)
- **B-type stars in the SMC show a binary fraction ≈80%**, considerably higher than in the Milky Way—**suggesting an anti-correlation between binary fraction and metallicity** for massive stars for the first time (top figure, [Villaseñor et al. 2025](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025A%26A...698A..41V/abstract)).
