## Overview

Most massive stars (M ≳ 8 M☉) live in binaries and many **exchange mass**—a process that reshapes their spins, orbits, and final fates. The **efficiency** of that mass transfer remains one of the biggest unknowns in binary-evolution models. This project searches for **mass-transferring Algol systems** (semi-detached binaries) at high spectral resolution and over multiple epochs to measure precise **orbits**, **component spectra**, and **atmospheric parameters**, to confronts detailed evolution models.

<strong>At a glance</strong><br>
• Telescope/instrument: ESO/MPG 2.2 m + FEROS (R≈48 000, 360–920 nm)<br>
• Time awarded: 76 h in P113 and 92 h in P114<br>
• Sample: 98 southern Algol/semidetached candidates, V ≲ 11, periods ≲ 12 d, earlier than B3<br>
• Observing strategy: 8 epochs per target; individual S/N = 90 at 4000 Å to reach combined S/N ≈ 250 for spectral disentangling.<br>
• Status: Student-led (F. Wallauer) first analysis (RV variability and initial orbital solutions) underway<br>

## Science goals

1) **Constrain mass-transfer efficiency.** Compare measured mass ratios (q), periods (P), and component properties against grids of detailed binary-evolution models to discriminate between conservative and non-conservative mass transfer pathways.

2) **Recover component spectra.** Use spectral **disentangling** to isolate both stars, then fit for **T<sub>eff</sub>**, **log g**, **v sin i**, and key **abundances** (He, N) to identify interaction products (stripped/bloated donors).

3) **Build a benchmark sample.** Massive Algols with well-measured parameters are surprisingly rare; this programme aims to deliver a homogeneous set suitable for constraining binary interactions and evolution.

## Methods

- **RVs & orbits.** Line-profile fitting to obtain RVs for SB1 and SB2 systems; full orbital solutions.
- **Spectral disentangling.** Separate composite spectra into primary/secondary contributions; recover **K<sub>1</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>** and flux ratios directly from the data.
- **Atmosphere analysis.** Joint fitting of both components with non-LTE models to obtain **T<sub>eff</sub>**, **log g**, **v sin i**, **He/N** abundances and masses.  

## Team & roles

- **PI / lead:** Jaime Villaseñor (programme design, RV/orbital pipeline; disentangling; atmosphere analysis).
- **Student:** Farah Wallauer (MPIA Summer Intern) leading the first pass on RVs and orbital solutions (2025).
- **Collaborators:** Koushik Sen (University of Arizona), Norbert Langer (Universität Bonn)
