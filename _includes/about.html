                    <p>I'm deeply intrigued by the world of massive binary stars. My research focuses on exploring their multiplicity properties, orbital dynamics, and complex evolutionary pathways. To uncover the profound connection between these aspects, I rely mainly on spectroscopic surveys of massive stars.</p>

                    <p>Through meticulous analysis of the spectra of massive stars, I hunt for binary systems at various stages of their lives. Each discovery contributes to our understanding of how binarity shapes the lives of these remarkable massive entities.</p>
                    
                    <p>Why massive binaries? Massive stars play a fundamental role in the Universe. 
                       Through their strong and hot winds, they completely alter their environment. 
                       Additionally, massive stars are the progenitors of exotic objects such as black 
                       holes and neutron stars. This means that in most cases, massive stars will 
                       explode as supernovae when forming those compact objects, enriching the 
                       interstellar medium and driving the chemical evolution of galaxies. Binarity adds 
                       even more excitement to the matter. By interacting with a close companion through 
                       mass exchange and mergers, the evolutionary paths of massive stars can drastically 
                       change, and this is the case for the majority of massive stars. Finally, in the 
                       last decade, a new dimension in the study of the cosmos has been 
                       confirmed:<a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/gw-sources" target="_blank">gravitational waves</a>have 
                       been detected thanks to the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (<a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/ligo-gw-interferometer" target="_blank">LIGO</a>) 
                       and the Virgo interferometer. Gravitational Waves are ripples in space-time that we 
                       can detect from very dense objects orbiting each other at very short distances. And 
                       guess what? These fascinating objects are exclusively produced by massive binary stars!</p>
