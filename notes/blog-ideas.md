# Blog ideas

Working list of potential future posts. Keep posts short, practical, and tied to a figure/result/tool when possible.

## Research
- A short tour of SDSS-V OBA Stars: what multi-epoch spectroscopy buys you.
- BLOeM: why metallicity matters for binary fractions (one key plot + takeaway).
- BBC: what we learn from orbits in 30 Doradus (period distribution + “compact companion” candidates).
- Galactic Algols: what “mass-transfer efficiency” means and why it’s hard.

## Methods
- Radial velocities in practice: what fails and what works (SB1/SB2, line selection, systematics).
- Spectral disentangling: what it is, when it helps, and common pitfalls.
- Reproducible astronomy workflows: notebooks vs scripts, and how I structure projects.

## Software
- MINATO: design goals and examples (RVs + orbit + spectral fits).
- Building lightweight Jekyll pages for research projects (data-driven publications, minimal maintenance).

## Career / meta (optional)
- How I prepare proposals and observing runs (checklists and time budgeting).
- Lessons from collaboration work: meeting organization and “good” documentation.

### Launch (Week 0)

- **Post 1 — Most massive stars don’t live alone: why binaries run the show**  
  Broad, public-friendly “why it matters” piece (supernovae, black holes, gravitational waves), plus a gentle 2–3 sentence “what I work on” tie-in.

---

### Weeks 1–4 (build shared language + trust)

- **Post 2 — Reading a star’s barcode: what a spectrum tells you (and what it can’t)**  
  Evergreen “spectroscopy 101” primer so later posts feel easy, not intimidating.

- **Post 3 — A short tour of SDSS-V OBA Stars: what multi-epoch spectroscopy buys you**  
  Core idea: repeated spectra → variability, binarity, better systematics control, rare discoveries.

- **Post 4 — Radial velocities in practice: what fails and what works (SB1/SB2, line choice, systematics)**  
  A very honest “here’s the messy reality” post that signals expertise without being too technical.

---

### Month 2–3 (flagship science stories)

- **Post 5 — BLOeM: why metallicity changes binary fractions (one key plot + one takeaway)**  
  “Same physics, different ingredients” framing. Keep it to one central figure + plain-language interpretation.

- **Post 6 — BBC in 30 Doradus: what we learn from orbits (and why some companions stay hidden)**  
  Period distribution intuition + how “compact companion candidates” emerge from patterns, not hype.

- **Post 7 — VFTS as the stepping stone: how we learned to do large multi-epoch spectroscopy well**  
  Narrative/history post that gives context to modern survey approaches (and your work in that lineage).

---

### Month 4–6 (deeper methods, still public-friendly)

- **Post 8 — Spectral disentangling: what it is, when it helps, and the traps people fall into**  
  “Two voices in one microphone” intuition + where it breaks.

- **Post 9 — Galactic Algols: what “mass-transfer efficiency” means and why it’s hard**  
  High drama + real uncertainty. Great outreach and a clear “active frontier” signal.

---

### Month 6–9 (software + reproducibility; advertise competence without sounding salesy)

- **Post 10 — Reproducible astronomy workflows: notebooks vs scripts, and how I structure projects**  
  Practical habits + a few concrete examples (directory structure, environment pinning, figures, releases).

- **(Flex) Post — MINATO: design goals and concrete examples (RVs → orbit → spectral fits)**  
  “What problem it solves” + 2–3 mini demos (later: screenshots/GIFs), minimal jargon.

- **(Flex) Post — Building lightweight Jekyll pages for research projects (data-driven pubs, low maintenance)**  
  A helpful how-to that quietly showcases your own site as proof.

### “Hot topic” slots (sprinkle when relevant; don’t force it)

- **Hot topic slot — Rubin / Gaia / big surveys / viral astronomy story:** “what’s true, what’s hype, what we can actually test”  
  Publish only when a story is peaking; your unique value is *how scientists verify claims*.
